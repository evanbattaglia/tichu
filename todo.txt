done:
[X] eliminate Player token; use id for this purpose. don't expose id to other players; they just use index (0 = self)
[x] make protocol terser
[x] some sort of event log
[x] test play logic
[x] automated player that basically plays randomly
[x] fix action bar
[x] test card functions
[x] test MainPlayer PassSplay
[x] history catch-up
[x] test error
[x] make validPlay work

critical:
[x] rich history (i.e. show cards played)
[x] show who passed you which cards
[x] fix history scroll to bottom on update :rageface: :why:
[x] deploy to heroku
[x] assets on heroku
[x] wish modal, wishing
[x] wish visible
[x] scores always visible
[x] disconnect message
[x] keepalive for heroku
[x] don't allow bombing out of turn when there are no cards on the table

important:
[x] preserve local hand order after play
[x] make play / trick winner indicators more better
[x] click card to play/unplay
[x] bomb button
[x] observer mode
[x] let the VIP shuffle players before the game starts
[x] repro and fix passing dragging weirdness
[ ] score table

nice to have:
[x] persistent button positioning in action bar
[ ] fix passing arrows when dragging out of a pass thing
[ ] centered play area of maximum size, as a stepping stone to dynamic card size
[ ] validPlay optimization
[ ] dynamic card size

wontfix:
[ ] fade at top of history -- looked a bit weird, fiddly to implement, a plain border works better
[ ] server-side history window -- game history is necessary to drive the score table on the client
[ ] fix passing replacement weirdness and re-enable swapping -- meh, too big a hassle for too small a gain
